## CHHTP

Only works on UNIX currently. Tested on Fedora 23.

My goal here is to learn more about socket/network programming. My hope is to end with a simple http server with the same functionality as python's http.server. But implemented in C.

You might say: "But  this has been implemented a million times by a million people." And you are correct. But I want to learn for myself. And so here we are.

I am using Beej's Guide to Network Programming to learn how to work with sockets/networking in C.
